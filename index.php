    <p> My name is Jinhee Byoun.<br>
      I have worked as a fashion designer for more than a decade, and
      returned to college for my second career. Attention to small details was
      a must in my trade. When I established my own kids’ clothing brand in
      Seattle, I was forced to multitask as the owner of a small business.</p>

    <p>I’m interested in database administration, analysis and creating a website.
      I am excited to bring my experience and expertise to the IT field. </p>
      
    <p>I like to watch movies with my husband after my girls are in bed.
      My favorites are coffee & tea, hiking in the Cascades, paddle boarding,
      organizing, and sushi.</p>
